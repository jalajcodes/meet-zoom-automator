## What it solves?

If you want to implement barrel exporting then you need to create Index.js file and then manually export all the files with correct path. But with **Barrel Exporter**, Index.js file is automatically created with correct exporting and path. Isn't it amazing!!

## Features

- Get all the upcoming events
- Set alarm for the events you want to attend
- Ring alarm 20 seconds before the meeting start time.
- Open the meeting automatically
- Create new events from the app itself.
- Browser Extension (Coming Soon)
